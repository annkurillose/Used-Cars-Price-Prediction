# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction

The data consists of information about used cars. It includes the details about the maker and the model of the car. It also includes physical features like number of doors and numbers of seats. In this project we will explore the factors that determine the price of pre-owned cars. Using these factors we will also predict the price of the car. All the details are explained in the project. 

Three file will be uploaded here:
(These files have to be used to run this python notebook in your systems.)

1) Training Data Set : Will be used to train the model and validate the model.
2) Testing Data Set :  Will be used to do the prediction. (We cannot check scores as original price is not available (As this data set is from a competition.))
3) Data Dictionary: It has the description of all the features.
